# Project Overview
This project is based around a sensor concentrator built on an ESP32S dev board with multiple ESP32 OLED packages as displays.
Voltage dividers will be required to bring the 5v working voltage of the sensors down to the 3.3v working voltage of the ESP32 module. 

Using this project you can place the sensor concentrator in the engine bay and provide 12v and connect into any 5v pressure transducers. Data will be sent over ESP-NOW to ESP32 OLED packages. These only require power.
